### Difficulty
The biggest difficulties I encountered was that I didn't have a very deep knowledge of the JavaScript base, however I knew a little about condition structures which was enough to give me an idea of how to proceed.

I started evaluating the whole process that I had to do and I broke the problems into small parts to make it easier to solve and, the details that I didn't know, I did a search on key points: "How to add a class to an element with JavaScript" - what it redirected me to several sites like StackOverflow, W3School and etc., where most of the content was about jQuery but, luckily, I managed to adapt.

One of the problems I encountered was with submitting the review, when submitted without a selection the thank you screen was not displayed, so I tried to 'loop' the list of elements and see if they all didn't have the class to display the 'review screen'. thanks' but that didn't work either, so I did a 'nested if' (I know it wasn't the best choice, but that's what I could think of at the time).
### What I learned from this project
I came into contact a lot with the manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) which gave me a wealth of knowledge to carry out future code challenges. I also reinforced my knowledge of CSS (specifically in Flexbox) during DOM manipulation and in the styling file itself.
